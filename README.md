# Paymo3 Plus - Linux
Paymo 3 Plus Linker for Linux

An application developed for linking time to Paymoapp.com - just like how you would do on Windows OS by using Paymo Plus Time Tracker. The main purpose to build this application is for those who are using [Paymo](http://paymoapp.com) but working on Linux.

###Dependencies
######pymouse:
<i>However, the dependancy pymouse has is xlib, which you need to download from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-xlib/)</i>

and then execute the following command to install
    
<code>
sudo apt-get install python-pip<br/>
sudo pip install python-xlib.tar.gz<br/>
sudo pip install pymouse
</code>

Once all dependancies are installed, you can start using the application.

Just start the "watcher.py" by typing following command<br/>
<code>
python watcher.py
</code>

Once you start the watcher, It will generate the timesheet CSV and will update automatically.

Once you finish the work, stop the watcher, and open the "index.html" - which is AngularJS application that communicate with Paymo through API. You will need the API key of your account from [Paymo](http://app.paymoapp.com) and timesheet generated by watcher.

Enjoy the application.
